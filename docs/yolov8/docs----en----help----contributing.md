### Google-Style Docstrings

When adding new functions or classes, include a [Google-style docstring](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) to provide clear and concise documentation for other developers. This helps ensure your contributions are easy to understand and maintain.

!!! Example "Example Docstrings"

    === "Google-style"

         This example shows a Google-style docstring. Note that both input and output `types` must always be enclosed by parentheses, i.e., `(bool)`.
         ```py
         def example_function(arg1, arg2=4):
             """
             Example function that demonstrates Google-style docstrings.

             Args:
                 arg1 (int): The first argument.
                 arg2 (int): The second argument. Default value is 4.

             Returns:
                 (bool): True if successful, False otherwise.

             Examples:
                 >>> result = example_function(1, 2)  # returns False
             """
             if arg1 == arg2:
                 return True
             return False
         ```

    === "Google-style with type hints"

         This example shows both a Google-style docstring and argument and return type hints, though both are not required; one can be used without the other.
         ```py
         def example_function(arg1: int, arg2: int = 4) -> bool:
             """
             Example function that demonstrates Google-style docstrings.

             Args:
                 arg1: The first argument.
                 arg2: The second argument. Default value is 4.

             Returns:
                 True if successful, False otherwise.

             Examples:
                 >>> result = example_function(1, 2)  # returns False
             """
             if arg1 == arg2:
                 return True
             return False
         ```

    === "Single-line"

         Smaller or simpler functions can utilize a single-line docstring. Note the docstring must use 3 double-quotes and be a complete sentence starting with a capital letter and ending with a period.
         ```py
         def example_small_function(arg1: int, arg2: int = 4) -> bool:
             """Example function that demonstrates a single-line docstring."""
             return arg1 == arg2
         ```

### GitHub Actions CI Tests

Before your pull request can be merged, all GitHub Actions [Continuous Integration](CI.md) (CI) tests must pass. These tests include linting, unit tests, and other checks to ensure your changes meet the project's quality standards. Review the output of the GitHub Actions and fix any issues.

## Reporting Bugs

We appreciate bug reports as they play a crucial role in maintaining the project's quality. When reporting bugs, it is important to provide a [Minimum Reproducible Example](minimum_reproducible_example.md): a clear, concise code example that replicates the issue. This helps in quick identification and resolution of the bug.
