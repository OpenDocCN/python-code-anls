## Key Features

### Unified Model Architecture

SAM2 combines the capabilities of image and video segmentation in a single model. This unification simplifies deployment and allows for consistent performance across different media types. It leverages a flexible prompt-based interface, enabling users to specify objects of interest through various prompt types, such as points, bounding boxes, or masks.

### Real-Time Performance

The model achieves real-time inference speeds, processing approximately 44 frames per second. This makes SAM2 suitable for applications requiring immediate feedback, such as video editing and augmented reality.

### Zero-Shot Generalization

SAM2 can segment objects it has never encountered before, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization. This is particularly useful in diverse or evolving visual domains where pre-defined categories may not cover all possible objects.

### Interactive Refinement

Users can iteratively refine the segmentation results by providing additional prompts, allowing for precise control over the output. This interactivity is essential for fine-tuning results in applications like video annotation or medical imaging.

### Advanced Handling of Visual Challenges

SAM2 includes mechanisms to manage common video segmentation challenges, such as object occlusion and reappearance. It uses a sophisticated memory mechanism to keep track of objects across frames, ensuring continuity even when objects are temporarily obscured or exit and re-enter the scene.

For a deeper understanding of SAM2's architecture and capabilities, explore the [SAM2 research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12741).

## Performance and Technical Details

SAM2 sets a new benchmark in the field, outperforming previous models on various metrics:

| Metric                             | SAM2          | Previous SOTA |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Interactive Video Segmentation** | **Best**      | -             |
| **Human Interactions Required**    | **3x fewer**  | Baseline      |
| **Image Segmentation Accuracy**    | **Improved**  | SAM           |
| **Inference Speed**                | **6x faster** | SAM           |

## Model Architecture

### Core Components

- **Image and Video Encoder**: Utilizes a transformer-based architecture to extract high-level features from both images and video frames. This component is responsible for understanding the visual content at each timestep.
- **Prompt Encoder**: Processes user-provided prompts (points, boxes, masks) to guide the segmentation task. This allows SAM2 to adapt to user input and target specific objects within a scene.
- **Memory Mechanism**: Includes a memory encoder, memory bank, and memory attention module. These components collectively store and utilize information from past frames, enabling the model to maintain consistent object tracking over time.
- **Mask Decoder**: Generates the final segmentation masks based on the encoded image features and prompts. In video, it also uses memory context to ensure accurate tracking across frames.

### Memory Mechanism and Occlusion Handling

The memory mechanism allows SAM2 to handle temporal dependencies and occlusions in video data. As objects move and interact, SAM2 records their features in a memory bank. When an object becomes occluded, the model can rely on this memory to predict its position and appearance when it reappears. The occlusion head specifically handles scenarios where objects are not visible, predicting the likelihood of an object being occluded.

### Multi-Mask Ambiguity Resolution

In situations with ambiguity (e.g., overlapping objects), SAM2 can generate multiple mask predictions. This feature is crucial for accurately representing complex scenes where a single mask might not sufficiently describe the scene's nuances.

## SA-V Dataset

The SA-V dataset, developed for SAM2's training, is one of the largest and most diverse video segmentation datasets available. It includes:

- **51,000+ Videos**: Captured across 47 countries, providing a wide range of real-world scenarios.
- **600,000+ Mask Annotations**: Detailed spatio-temporal mask annotations, referred to as "masklets," covering whole objects and parts.
- **Dataset Scale**: It features 4.5 times more videos and 53 times more annotations than previous largest datasets, offering unprecedented diversity and complexity.

## Benchmarks

### SAM2 Prediction Examples

SAM2 can be utilized across a broad spectrum of tasks, including real-time video editing, medical imaging, and autonomous systems. Its ability to segment both static and dynamic visual data makes it a versatile tool for researchers and developers.

#### Segment with Prompts

!!! Example "Segment with Prompts"

    Use prompts to segment specific objects in images or videos.

    === "Python"

        ```py
        from ultralytics import SAM2

        # Load a model
        model = SAM2("sam2_b.pt")

        # Display model information (optional)
        model.info()

        # Segment with bounding box prompt
        results = model("path/to/image.jpg", bboxes=[100, 100, 200, 200])

        # Segment with point prompt
        results = model("path/to/image.jpg", points=[150, 150], labels=[1])
        ```

#### Segment Everything

!!! Example "Segment Everything"

    Segment the entire image or video content without specific prompts.

    === "Python"

        ```py
        from ultralytics import SAM2

        # Load a model
        model = SAM2("sam2_b.pt")

        # Display model information (optional)
        model.info()

        # Run inference
        model("path/to/video.mp4")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```py
        # Run inference with a SAM2 model
        yolo predict model=sam2_b.pt source=path/to/video.mp4
        ```

- This example demonstrates how SAM2 can be used to segment the entire content of an image or video if no prompts (bboxes/points/masks) are provided.

## SAM comparison vs YOLOv8

Here we compare Meta's smallest SAM model, SAM-b, with Ultralytics smallest segmentation model, [YOLOv8n-seg](../tasks/segment.md):

| Model                                          | Size                       | Parameters             | Speed (CPU)                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Meta's SAM-b                                   | 358 MB                     | 94.7 M                 | 51096 ms/im                |
| [MobileSAM](mobile-sam.md)                     | 40.7 MB                    | 10.1 M                 | 46122 ms/im                |
| [FastSAM-s](fast-sam.md) with YOLOv8 backbone  | 23.7 MB                    | 11.8 M                 | 115 ms/im                  |
| Ultralytics [YOLOv8n-seg](../tasks/segment.md) | **6.7 MB** (53.4x smaller) | **3.4 M** (27.9x less) | **59 ms/im** (866x faster) |

This comparison shows the order-of-magnitude differences in the model sizes and speeds between models. Whereas SAM presents unique capabilities for automatic segmenting, it is not a direct competitor to YOLOv8 segment models, which are smaller, faster and more efficient.

Tests run on a 2023 Apple M2 Macbook with 16GB of RAM. To reproduce this test:

    === "Python"

        ```py
        from ultralytics import SAM, YOLO, FastSAM

        # Profile SAM-b
        model = SAM("sam_b.pt")
        model.info()
        model("ultralytics/assets")

        # Profile MobileSAM
        model = SAM("mobile_sam.pt")
        model.info()
        model("ultralytics/assets")

        # Profile FastSAM-s
        model = FastSAM("FastSAM-s.pt")
        model.info()

        # Profile YOLOv8n-seg
        model = YOLO("yolov8n-seg.pt")
        model.info()
        model("ultralytics/assets")
        ```

## Limitations

Despite its strengths, SAM2 has certain limitations:

- **Tracking Stability**: SAM2 may lose track of objects during extended sequences or significant viewpoint changes.
- **Object Confusion**: The model can sometimes confuse similar-looking objects, particularly in crowded scenes.
- **Efficiency with Multiple Objects**: Segmentation efficiency decreases when processing multiple objects simultaneously due to the lack of inter-object communication.
- **Detail Accuracy**: May miss fine details, especially with fast-moving objects. Additional prompts can partially address this issue, but temporal smoothness is not guaranteed.
