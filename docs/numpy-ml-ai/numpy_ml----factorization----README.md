# Factors
The `factors.py` module includes common approximate matrix-factorization
algorithms including:

- Regularized alternating least squares (ALS)
- Non-negative matrix factorization via fast hierarchical least squares (HALS) ([Cichocki & Phan, 2008](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.214.6398&rep=rep1&type=pdf))
