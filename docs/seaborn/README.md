Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.


Documentation
-------------

Online documentation is available at [seaborn.pydata.org](https://seaborn.pydata.org).

The docs include a [tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html), [example gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), [API reference](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html), [FAQ](https://seaborn.pydata.org/faq), and other useful information.

To build the documentation locally, please refer to [`doc/README.md`](doc/README.md).

Dependencies
------------

Seaborn supports Python 3.8+.

Installation requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). Some advanced statistical functionality requires [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and/or [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/).


Installation
------------

The latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from PyPI:

    pip install seaborn

It is also possible to include optional statistical dependencies:

    pip install seaborn[stats]

Seaborn can also be installed with conda:

    conda install seaborn

Note that the main anaconda repository lags PyPI in adding new releases, but conda-forge (`-c conda-forge`) typically updates quickly.

Citing
------

A paper describing seaborn has been published in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03021). The paper provides an introduction to the key features of the library, and it can be used as a citation if seaborn proves integral to a scientific publication.

Testing
-------

Testing seaborn requires installing additional dependencies; they can be installed with the `dev` extra (e.g., `pip install .[dev]`).

To test the code, run `make test` in the source directory. This will exercise the unit tests (using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)) and generate a coverage report.

Code style is enforced with `flake8` using the settings in the [`setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg) file. Run `make lint` to check. Alternately, you can use `pre-commit` to automatically run lint checks on any files you are committing: just run `pre-commit install` to set it up, and then commit as usual going forward.

Development
-----------

Seaborn development takes place on Github: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn

Please submit bugs that you encounter to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues) with a reproducible example demonstrating the problem. Questions about usage are more at home on StackOverflow, where there is a [seaborn tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/seaborn).
