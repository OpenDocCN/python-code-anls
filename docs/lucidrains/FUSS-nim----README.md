## FUSS - Nim (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610126">FUSS (Fitness Uniform Selection)</a>, a selection method proposed by Marcus Hutter himself for maintaining diversity in evolutionary algorithms, in Nim

Basically will be a rewrite of <a href="http://www.hutter1.net/ai/fussdd.cpp">FUSS in C</a>
