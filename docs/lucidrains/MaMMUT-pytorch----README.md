## MaMMUT - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16839">MaMMUT</a>, a simple vision-encoder text-decoder architecture for multimodal tasks from Google, in Pytorch. <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/05/mammut-simple-vision-encoder-text.html">Blog post</a>

This work is basically just a simplified CoCa. I copied the code from <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/CoCa-pytorch">this repository</a> and made the change in the paper, which was to simply do two passes through the text encoder, one with cross attention for the generative loss, and the other without for the contrastive loss.

This is also a good time to plug <a href="https://laion.ai/blog/coca/">an open sourced version of CoCa</a> from the folks at <a href="https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip">OpenCLIP</a>!

## Install

```bash
$ pip install mammut-pytorch
```

## Usage

First install the `vit-pytorch` for the image encoder, which needs to be pretrained

```bash
$ pip install vit-pytorch>=0.40.2
```

Then

```python
import torch

# import vision transformer

from vit_pytorch.simple_vit_with_patch_dropout import SimpleViT
from vit_pytorch.extractor import Extractor

vit = SimpleViT(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 32,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 16,
    mlp_dim = 2048,
    patch_dropout = 0.5  # https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00794
)

vit = Extractor(vit, return_embeddings_only = True, detach = False)

# extractor will enable it so the vision transformer returns its embeddings

# import MaMMUT and instantiate it

from mammut_pytorch.mammut_pytorch import MaMMUT

mammut = MaMMUT(
    dim = 512,                     # model dimension
    img_encoder = vit,             # vision transformer - image encoder, returning image embeddings as (batch, seq, dim)
    image_dim = 1024,              # image embedding dimension, if not the same as model dimensions
    num_tokens = 20000,            # number of text tokens
    depth = 6,                     # depth of the transformer
    dim_head = 64,                 # dimension per attention head
    heads = 8,                     # number of attention heads
    caption_loss_weight = 1.,      # weight on the autoregressive caption loss
    contrastive_loss_weight = 1.,  # weight on the contrastive loss between image and text CLS embeddings
).cuda()

# mock text and images

text = torch.randint(0, 20000, (4, 512)).cuda()
images = torch.randn(4, 3, 256, 256).cuda()

# train by giving MaMMUT your text and images with `return_loss = True`

loss = mammut(
    text = text,
    images = images,
    return_loss = True  # set this to True to get the full caption + contrastive loss
)

loss.backward()

# do the above for as much text and images...
# then you can get the caption logits as so

logits = mammut(
    text = text,
    images = images
) # (4, 512, 20000)

# and the CLIP-like text and image embeddings as

text_embeds, image_embeds = mammut(
    text = text,
    images = images,
    return_embeddings = True
) # (4, 512), (4, 512)
```

One of the main findings of the paper is that different tasks perform differently depending on the amount of cross attention. This repository will give you full control over how much cross attention you want to place in the network.

```python
mammut = MaMMUT(
    dim = 512,
    img_encoder = vit,
    image_dim = 1024,
    num_tokens = 20000,
    depth = 6,
    cross_attend_every = 2,   # say you want to cross attend only every 2 layers
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8,
    caption_loss_weight = 1.,
    contrastive_loss_weight = 1.
).cuda()

# or you can finely specify which layers to do cross attention

mammut = MaMMUT(
    dim = 512,
    img_encoder = vit,
    image_dim = 1024,
    num_tokens = 20000,
    depth = 6,
    cross_attend_layers = (4, 5, 6),  # only last three layers have cross attention
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8,
    caption_loss_weight = 1.,
    contrastive_loss_weight = 1.
).cuda()
```

## Todo

- [ ] offer masked mean pooling of text embeddings and mean pooling for images for contrastive latents
