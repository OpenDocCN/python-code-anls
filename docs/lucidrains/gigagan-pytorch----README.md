## GigaGAN - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05511v2">GigaGAN</a> <a href="https://mingukkang.github.io/GigaGAN/">(project page)</a>, new SOTA GAN out of Adobe.

I will also add a few findings from <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/lightweight-gan">lightweight gan</a>, for faster convergence (skip layer excitation) and better stability (reconstruction auxiliary loss in discriminator)

It will also contain the code for the 1k - 4k upsamplers, which I find to be the highlight of this paper.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install gigagan-pytorch
```

## Usage

Simple unconditional GAN, for starters

```python
import torch

from gigagan_pytorch import (
    GigaGAN,
    ImageDataset
)

gan = GigaGAN(
    generator = dict(
        dim_capacity = 8,
        style_network = dict(
            dim = 64,
            depth = 4
        ),
        image_size = 256,
        dim_max = 512,
        num_skip_layers_excite = 4,
        unconditional = True
    ),
    discriminator = dict(
        dim_capacity = 16,
        dim_max = 512,
        image_size = 256,
        num_skip_layers_excite = 4,
        unconditional = True
    ),
    amp = True
).cuda()

# dataset

dataset = ImageDataset(
    folder = '/path/to/your/data',
    image_size = 256
)

dataloader = dataset.get_dataloader(batch_size = 1)

# you must then set the dataloader for the GAN before training

gan.set_dataloader(dataloader)

# training the discriminator and generator alternating
# for 100 steps in this example, batch size 1, gradient accumulated 8 times

gan(
    steps = 100,
    grad_accum_every = 8
)

# after much training

images = gan.generate(batch_size = 4) # (4, 3, 256, 256)
```

For unconditional Unet Upsampler

```python
import torch
from gigagan_pytorch import (
    GigaGAN,
    ImageDataset
)

gan = GigaGAN(
    train_upsampler = True,     # set this to True
    generator = dict(
        style_network = dict(
            dim = 64,
            depth = 4
        ),
        dim = 32,
        image_size = 256,
        input_image_size = 64,
        unconditional = True
    ),
    discriminator = dict(
        dim_capacity = 16,
        dim_max = 512,
        image_size = 256,
        num_skip_layers_excite = 4,
        multiscale_input_resolutions = (128,),
        unconditional = True
    ),
    amp = True
).cuda()

dataset = ImageDataset(
    folder = '/path/to/your/data',
    image_size = 256
)

dataloader = dataset.get_dataloader(batch_size = 1)

gan.set_dataloader(dataloader)

# training the discriminator and generator alternating
# for 100 steps in this example, batch size 1, gradient accumulated 8 times

gan(
    steps = 100,
    grad_accum_every = 8
)

# after much training

lowres = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64).cuda()

images = gan.generate(lowres) # (1, 3, 256, 256)
```

## Losses

* `G` - Generator
* `MSG` - Multiscale Generator
* `D` - Discriminator
* `MSD` - Multiscale Discriminator
* `GP` - Gradient Penalty
* `SSL` - Auxiliary Reconstruction in Discriminator (from Lightweight GAN)
* `VD` - Vision-aided Discriminator
* `VG` - Vision-aided Generator
* `CL` - Generator Constrastive Loss
* `MAL` - Matching Aware Loss

A healthy run would have `G`, `MSG`, `D`, `MSD` with values hovering between `0` to `10`, and usually staying pretty constant. If at any time after 1k training steps these values persist at triple digits, that would mean something is wrong. It is ok for generator and discriminator values to occasionally dip negative, but it should swing back up to the range above.

`GP` and `SSL` should be pushed towards `0`. `GP` can occasionally spike; I like to imagine it as the networks undergoing some epiphany

## Multi-GPU Training

The `GigaGAN` class is now equipped with <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/accelerator">ðŸ¤— Accelerator</a>. You can easily do multi-gpu training in two steps using their `accelerate` CLI

At the project root directory, where the training script is, run

```python
$ accelerate config
```

Then, in the same directory

```python
$ accelerate launch train.py
```
