## Recurrent Memory Transformer - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06881">Recurrent Memory Transformer</a> <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Uynr3iPhksa">(openreview)</a> in Pytorch. They had <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11062">a short follow up paper</a> recently that demonstrated it was able to copy information across 1 million tokens at the very least.

There is no doubt in my mind that RMT would make a stronger RL agent than <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/adaptive-agent/">AdA</a>, which is just a Transformer-XL - Update: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09459">Recurrent Memory Decision Transformer</a>

## Install

```bash
$ pip install recurrent-memory-transformer-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from recurrent_memory_transformer_pytorch import RecurrentMemoryTransformer

model = RecurrentMemoryTransformer(
    num_tokens = 20000,               # number of tokens
    num_memory_tokens = 128,          # number of memory tokens, this will determine the bottleneck for information being passed to the future
    dim = 512,                        # model dimensions
    depth = 6,                        # transformer depth
    causal = True,                    # autoregressive or not
    dim_head = 64,                    # dimension per head
    heads = 8,                        # heads
    seq_len = 1024,                   # sequence length of a segment
    use_flash_attn = True             # whether to use flash attention
)

x = torch.randint(0, 256, (1, 1024))

logits1, mem1, _ = model(x)        # (1, 1024, 20000), (1, 128, 512), None
logits2, mem2, _ = model(x, mem1)  # (1, 1024, 20000), (1, 128, 512), None
logits3, mem3, _ = model(x, mem2)  # (1, 1024, 20000), (1, 128, 512), None

# and so on ...

```

With XL memories

```python
import torch
from recurrent_memory_transformer_pytorch import RecurrentMemoryTransformer

model = RecurrentMemoryTransformer(
    num_tokens = 20000,
    num_memory_tokens = 128,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6,
    causal = True,
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8,
    seq_len = 1024,
    use_flash_attn = True,
    use_xl_memories = True,    # set this to True
    xl_mem_len = 512           # can be shorter than the seq len - i think just having a bit of the past will prevent much of the RMT memories  memorizing the immediate preceding text
)

x = torch.randint(0, 256, (1, 1024))

logits1, mem1, xl_mem1 = model(x)                               # (1, 1024, 20000), (1, 128, 512), [(2, 1, 512, 512)]
logits2, mem2, xl_mem2 = model(x, mem1, xl_memories = xl_mem1)  # (1, 1024, 20000), (1, 128, 512), [(2, 1, 512, 512)]
logits3, mem3, xl_mem3 = model(x, mem2, xl_memories = xl_mem2)  # (1, 1024, 20000), (1, 128, 512), [(2, 1, 512, 512)]

# and so on ...
```

Train on an absurdly long sequence

```python
import torch
from recurrent_memory_transformer_pytorch import (
    RecurrentMemoryTransformer,
    RecurrentMemoryTransformerWrapper
)

model = RecurrentMemoryTransformer(
    num_tokens = 256,
    num_memory_tokens = 128,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6,
    seq_len = 1024,
    use_flash_attn = True,
    causal = True
)

model = RecurrentMemoryTransformerWrapper(model).cuda()

seq = torch.randint(0, 256, (4, 65536)).cuda()   # absurdly long sequence, in reality, they curriculum learned this starting with 1 segment to about 7-8 segments

loss = model(seq, memory_replay_backprop = True) # memory efficient training from memformer paper

```

## Todo

- [ ] move the memory replay backprop into a torch.function, test out bidirectional, then test on a real problem

- [x] get rotary embeddings working properly with xl memories
- [x] add xl memories, detached
- [x] offer a way to turn off rotary embeddings, absolute positional embeddings, and add token shift
- [x] make memories being causally masked an option
- [x] add the memory replay backprop technique from memformer paper
- [x] relative positional encoding
