## Simple Hierarchical Transformer

Experiments around a simple idea for inducing multiple hierarchical predictive coding models within a GPT. It is so simple, it may not work. But then again, deep learning progress is built on the bedrocks of simple ideas. Worth a shot.

So far, the idea has passed the litmus test from a research friend. Will bring it to completion in the next week or so. If it does not work out, I'll leave the negative experimental results as well as the repository around, and maybe some PhD student can build upon it.

Update: I think it is working ðŸ¤ž

## Install

```
$ pip install simple-hierarchical-transformer
```

## Usage

Three hierarchies, all servicing predicting the next token

```python
import torch
from simple_hierarchical_transformer import HierarchicalTransformer

model = HierarchicalTransformer(
    num_tokens = 20000,                # number of tokens
    dim = 512,                         # model dimensions
    depth = 6,                         # depth
    dim_head = 64,                     # dimension per attention head
    heads = 8,                         # attention heads
    seq_len = 2048,                    # sequence lengths
    hierarchies = (1, 2, 8),           # hierarchies - here we have 1x (like in a regular transformer), then 2x and 8x compressed hierarchical tokens that undergo their own transformer blocks. information is pooled into one hierarchy at each layer
    window_sizes = (32, 64, None)      # local attention window sizes - the idea is that the higher hierarchies can pass distant information to the local one. None stands for full receptive field. Setting 0 would turn off attention at this hierarchy altogether (while token shift will still be in effect in each layer)
)

ids = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 2048))

loss, _ = model(ids, return_loss = True)
loss.backward()

# after much training

logits = model(ids)
```

By not specifying `hierarchies` and `window_sizes`, you basically default to a regular autoregressive transformer with attention across full sequence length.

```python

# non-hierarchical transformer

model = HierarchicalTransformer(
    num_tokens = 20000,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 8,
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8,
    seq_len = 2048,
    hierarchies = 1,        # implied 1 if not set
    window_sizes = None     # implied None (full sequence length) if not set
)

```

Now something more complex. Experiments show that as you compress up the hierarchies, you need greater model dimensions for appropriate capacity.

```python
model = HierarchicalTransformer(
    num_tokens = 256,
    dim = (128, 256, 512, 1024),
    depth = 8,
    seq_len = 1024,
    use_flash_attn = True,
    ff_mult = (2, 2, 4, 4),
    dim_head = (16, 32, 64, 64),
    heads = (2, 4, 8, 8),
    hierarchies = (1, 2, 4, 16),
    hierarchical_stride = (1, 1, 1, 8),  # this would determine the stride when compressing, and when concatting the hierarchical tokens to the fine tokens, the past tokens will be repeated this amount of time. causality is not violated as using the trick from hourglass transformers where sequence is shifted by compression factor - 1. recommend sticking with 1 except for highly compressed hierarchies, as it becomes very uncompetitive with baseline and generations look off
    window_sizes = (16, 32, 64, None)
).cuda()

# hierarchies
# 1x - dim 128 - attention (2 heads, 16 dim, receptive field 16)
# 2x - dim 256 - attention (4 heads, 32 dim, receptive field 32)
# 4x - dim 512 - attention (8 heads, 64 dim, receptive field 64)
# 8x - dim 1024 - attention (8 heads, 64 dim, receptive field of all)
```

## Todo

- [x] branch out to two parallel paths, one for hierarchical tokens, other for plain fine tokens.
- [x] show that local attention in fine + hierarchical tokens can come close to full attention baseline
- [x] simple dsconv seems enough to merge for 1 hierarchy
- [x] auto-set window size to be half of max sequence length for fine and all hierarchies
- [x] figure out effects of just pooling all fine + hierarchical tokens before cross entropy loss - not much of a difference
- [x] complete ability to add any number of hierarchies, and designate which hierarchy will pool the information from the others for prediction
- [x] fully customizable dimensions across hierarchies, as higher hierarchies require greater model dimensions
- [x] add prophet losses for hierarchical branches
- [x] allow for repeating hierarchy tokens for fine tokens in the future, as position may matter less as one goes up the hierarchy. but not a priority, get things working first - implemented as `hierarchical_stride`
- [x] allow for some layers to only rely on token shift, no attention
- [x] random projections + vq, as was done in universal speech model paper from brain - for hierarchical predictive coding

- [ ] allow for specifying which hierarchy receives information from the others during merging, maybe design a specialized attention with masking, but need to account fo different model dimensions across hierarchies
- [ ] build out simple local attention block, for use across all hierarchies
- [ ] add flash attention to local attention library
- [ ] figure out if attention can be shared across hierarchies
- [ ] do a clean wandb report showing 2x compression without much loss for character level enwik8
- [ ] try a self attention based compressor for hierarchies 4 or above
- [ ] build a small autoencoder using the token embeddings as input, at the very beginning of the network, and then use intermediate feature maps for each parallel hierarchical network
