## Natural Speech 2 - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09116">Natural Speech 2</a>, Zero-shot Speech and Singing Synthesizer, in Pytorch

NaturalSpeech 2 is a TTS system that leverages a neural audio codec with continuous latent vectors and a latent diffusion model with non-autoregressive generation to enable natural and zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis

This repository will use denoising diffusion rather than score-based SDE, and may potentially offer elucidated version as well. It will also offer improvements for the attention / transformer components wherever applicable.

## Appreciation

## Install

```bash
$ pip install naturalspeech2-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from naturalspeech2_pytorch import (
    EncodecWrapper,
    Model,
    NaturalSpeech2
)

# use encodec as an example

codec = EncodecWrapper()

model = Model(
    dim = 128,
    depth = 6
)

# natural speech diffusion model

diffusion = NaturalSpeech2(
    model = model,
    codec = codec,
    timesteps = 1000
).cuda()

# mock raw audio data

raw_audio = torch.randn(4, 327680).cuda()

loss = diffusion(raw_audio)
loss.backward()

# do the above in a loop for a lot of raw audio data...
# then you can sample from your generative model as so

generated_audio = diffusion.sample(length = 1024) # (1, 327680)

```

With conditioning

ex.

```python
import torch
from naturalspeech2_pytorch import (
    EncodecWrapper,
    Model,
    NaturalSpeech2,
    SpeechPromptEncoder
)

# use encodec as an example

codec = EncodecWrapper()

model = Model(
    dim = 128,
    depth = 6,
    dim_prompt = 512,
    cond_drop_prob = 0.25,                  # dropout prompt conditioning with this probability, for classifier free guidance
    condition_on_prompt = True
)

# natural speech diffusion model

diffusion = NaturalSpeech2(
    model = model,
    codec = codec,
    timesteps = 1000
)

# mock raw audio data

raw_audio = torch.randn(4, 327680)
prompt = torch.randn(4, 32768)               # they randomly excised a range on the audio for the prompt during training, eventually will take care of this auto-magically

text = torch.randint(0, 100, (4, 100))
text_lens = torch.tensor([100, 50 , 80, 100])

# forwards and backwards

loss = diffusion(
    audio = raw_audio,
    text = text,
    text_lens = text_lens,
    prompt = prompt
)

loss.backward()

# after much training

generated_audio = diffusion.sample(
    length = 1024,
    text = text,
    prompt = prompt
) # (1, 327680)
```

Or if you want a `Trainer` class to take care of the training and sampling loop, just simply do

```python
from naturalspeech2_pytorch import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
    diffusion_model = diffusion,     # diffusion model + codec from above
    folder = '/path/to/speech',
    train_batch_size = 16,
    gradient_accumulate_every = 2,
)

trainer.train()
```

## Todo

- [x] complete perceiver then cross attention conditioning on ddpm side
- [x] add classifier free guidance, even if not in paper
- [x] complete duration / pitch prediction during training - thanks to Manmay
- [x] make sure pyworld way of computing pitch can also work

- [ ] consult phd student in TTS field about pyworld usage
- [ ] also offer direct summation conditioning using spear-tts text-to-semantic module, if available
- [ ] add self-conditioning on ddpm side
- [ ] take care of automatic slicing of audio for prompt, being aware of minimal audio segment as allowed by the codec model
- [ ] make sure curtail_from_left works for encodec, figure out what they are doing
