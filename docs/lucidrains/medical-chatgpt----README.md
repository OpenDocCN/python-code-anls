Explorations into training a ChatGPT, but tailored towards primary care medicine, with the reward being able to collect patient histories in a thorough and efficient manner and come up with a differential diagnosis. May also explore to see if it can be further fine-tuned on pirated copies of Up-To-Date for specialist knowledge

Sadly, I no longer think this is possible in its current state. It will probably see some utility with scribing of basic bread and butter cases; however assess and plan it cannot.
