## Lumiere - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://lumiere-video.github.io/">Lumiere</a>, SOTA text-to-video generation from Google Deepmind, in Pytorch

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl8BET_K1mc">Yannic's paper review</a>

Since this paper is mostly just a few key ideas on top of text-to-image model, will take it a step further and extend the new <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch/blob/main/denoising_diffusion_pytorch/karras_unet.py">Karras U-net</a> to video within this repository.

## Appreciation

- <a href="https://a16z.com/supporting-the-open-source-ai-community/">A16Z Open Source AI Grant Program</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/">ðŸ¤— Huggingface</a> for the generous sponsorships, as well as my other sponsors, for affording me the independence to open source current artificial intelligence research

## Install

```bash
$ pip install lumiere-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from lumiere_pytorch import MPLumiere

from denoising_diffusion_pytorch import KarrasUnet

karras_unet = KarrasUnet(
    image_size = 256,
    dim = 8,
    channels = 3,
    dim_max = 768
)

lumiere = MPLumiere(
    karras_unet,
    image_size = 256,
    unet_time_kwarg = 'time',
    conv_module_names = [
        'downs.1',
        'ups.1'
    ],
    attn_module_names = [
        'mids.0'
    ],
    upsample_module_names = [
        'ups.1'
    ],
    downsample_module_names = [
        'downs.1'
    ]
)

noised_video = torch.randn(2, 3, 8, 256, 256)
time = torch.ones(2,)

denoised_video = lumiere(noised_video, time = time)

assert noised_video.shape == denoised_video.shape
```

## Todo

- [x] add all temporal layers
    - [x] researcher must pass in all layers for
        - [x] conv inflation modules (stages)
        - [x] attn inflation modules (middle)
        - [x] temporal downsample
        - [x] temporal upsamples
    - [x] validate time dimension is 2 ** downsample layers
    - [x] validate number of downsamples == upsamples
    - [x] at init, do a dry run with a mock tensor and assert output is the same

- [x] expose only temporal parameters for learning, freeze everything else
- [x] figure out the best way to deal with the time conditioning after temporal downsampling - instead of pytree transform at the beginning, probably will need to hook into all the modules and inspect the batch sizes
- [x] handle middle modules that may have output shape as `(batch, seq, dim)`
- [x] following the conclusions of Tero Karras, improvise a variant of the 4 modules with magnitude preservation

- [ ] test out on <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/imagen-pytorch">imagen-pytorch</a>
- [ ] look into multi-diffusion and see if it can turned into some simple wrapper
