## gMLP - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08050">gMLP</a>, an all-MLP replacement for Transformers, in Pytorch

## Install

```bash
$ pip install g-mlp-pytorch
```

## Usage

For masked language modelling

```python
import torch
from torch import nn
from g_mlp_pytorch import gMLP

model = gMLP(
    num_tokens = 20000,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6,
    seq_len = 256,
    circulant_matrix = True,      # use circulant weight matrix for linear increase in parameters in respect to sequence length
    act = nn.Tanh()               # activation for spatial gate (defaults to identity)
)

x = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 256))
logits = model(x) # (1, 256, 20000)
```

For image classification

```python
import torch
from g_mlp_pytorch import gMLPVision

model = gMLPVision(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 16,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)
logits = model(img) # (1, 1000)
```

You can also add a tiny amount of attention (one-headed) to boost performance, as mentioned in the paper as `aMLP`, with the addition of one extra keyword `attn_dim`. This applies to both `gMLPVision` and `gMLP`

```python
import torch
from g_mlp_pytorch import gMLPVision

model = gMLPVision(
    image_size = 256,
    patch_size = 16,
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6,
    attn_dim = 64
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)
pred = model(img) # (1, 1000)
```

Non-square images and patch sizes

```python
import torch
from g_mlp_pytorch import gMLPVision

model = gMLPVision(
    image_size = (256, 128),
    patch_size = (16, 8),
    num_classes = 1000,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6,
    attn_dim = 64
)

img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 128)
pred = model(img) # (1, 1000)
```

## Experimental

A independent researcher proposes using a multi-headed approach for gMLPs in <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/395005917">a blogpost on Zhihu</a>. To do so, just set `heads` to be greater than `1`

```python
import torch
from torch import nn
from g_mlp_pytorch import gMLP

model = gMLP(
    num_tokens = 20000,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6,
    seq_len = 256,
    causal = True,
    circulant_matrix = True,
    heads = 4 # 4 heads
)

x = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 256))
logits = model(x) # (1, 256, 20000)
```
