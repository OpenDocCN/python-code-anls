## iTransformer

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06625">iTransformer</a> - SOTA Time Series Forecasting using Attention networks, out of Tsinghua / Ant group

All that remains is tabular data (xgboost still champion here) before one can truly declare "Attention is all you need"

In before Apple gets the authors to change the name.

The official implementation has been released <a href="https://github.com/thuml/iTransformer">here</a>!

## Appreciation

- <a href="https://stability.ai/">StabilityAI</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/">ðŸ¤— Huggingface</a> for the generous sponsorship, as well as my other sponsors, for affording me the independence to open source current artificial intelligence techniques.

- <a href="https://github.com/gdevos010">Greg DeVos</a> for sharing <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/iTransformer/issues/20">experiments</a> he ran on `iTransformer` and some of the improvised variants

## Install

```bash
$ pip install iTransformer
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from iTransformer import iTransformer

# using solar energy settings

model = iTransformer(
    num_variates = 137,
    lookback_len = 96,                  # or the lookback length in the paper
    dim = 256,                          # model dimensions
    depth = 6,                          # depth
    heads = 8,                          # attention heads
    dim_head = 64,                      # head dimension
    pred_length = (12, 24, 36, 48),     # can be one prediction, or many
    num_tokens_per_variate = 1,         # experimental setting that projects each variate to more than one token. the idea is that the network can learn to divide up into time tokens for more granular attention across time. thanks to flash attention, you should be able to accommodate long sequence lengths just fine
    use_reversible_instance_norm = True # use reversible instance normalization, proposed here https://openreview.net/forum?id=cGDAkQo1C0p . may be redundant given the layernorms within iTransformer (and whatever else attention learns emergently on the first layer, prior to the first layernorm). if i come across some time, i'll gather up all the statistics across variates, project them, and condition the transformer a bit further. that makes more sense
)

time_series = torch.randn(2, 96, 137)  # (batch, lookback len, variates)

preds = model(time_series)

# preds -> Dict[int, Tensor[batch, pred_length, variate]]
#       -> (12: (2, 12, 137), 24: (2, 24, 137), 36: (2, 36, 137), 48: (2, 48, 137))
```

For an improvised version that does granular attention across time tokens (as well as the original per-variate tokens), just import `iTransformer2D` and set the additional `num_time_tokens`

Update: It works! Thanks goes out to <a href="https://github.com/gdevos010">Greg DeVos</a> for running the experiment <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/iTransformer/issues/6#issuecomment-1794989685">here</a>!

Update 2: Got an email. Yes you are free to write a paper on this, if the architecture holds up for your problem. I have no skin in the game

```python
import torch
from iTransformer import iTransformer2D

# using solar energy settings

model = iTransformer2D(
    num_variates = 137,
    num_time_tokens = 16,               # number of time tokens (patch size will be (look back length // num_time_tokens))
    lookback_len = 96,                  # the lookback length in the paper
    dim = 256,                          # model dimensions
    depth = 6,                          # depth
    heads = 8,                          # attention heads
    dim_head = 64,                      # head dimension
    pred_length = (12, 24, 36, 48),     # can be one prediction, or many
    use_reversible_instance_norm = True # use reversible instance normalization
)

time_series = torch.randn(2, 96, 137)  # (batch, lookback len, variates)

preds = model(time_series)

# preds -> Dict[int, Tensor[batch, pred_length, variate]]
#       -> (12: (2, 12, 137), 24: (2, 24, 137), 36: (2, 36, 137), 48: (2, 48, 137))
```

## Experimental

### iTransformer with fourier tokens

A `iTransformer` but also with fourier tokens (FFT of time series is projected into tokens of their own and attended along side with the variate tokens, spliced out at the end)

```python
import torch
from iTransformer import iTransformerFFT

# using solar energy settings

model = iTransformerFFT(
    num_variates = 137,
    lookback_len = 96,                  # or the lookback length in the paper
    dim = 256,                          # model dimensions
    depth = 6,                          # depth
    heads = 8,                          # attention heads
    dim_head = 64,                      # head dimension
    pred_length = (12, 24, 36, 48),     # can be one prediction, or many
    num_tokens_per_variate = 1,         # experimental setting that projects each variate to more than one token. the idea is that the network can learn to divide up into time tokens for more granular attention across time. thanks to flash attention, you should be able to accommodate long sequence lengths just fine
    use_reversible_instance_norm = True # use reversible instance normalization, proposed here https://openreview.net/forum?id=cGDAkQo1C0p . may be redundant given the layernorms within iTransformer (and whatever else attention learns emergently on the first layer, prior to the first layernorm). if i come across some time, i'll gather up all the statistics across variates, project them, and condition the transformer a bit further. that makes more sense
)

time_series = torch.randn(2, 96, 137)  # (batch, lookback len, variates)

preds = model(time_series)

# preds -> Dict[int, Tensor[batch, pred_length, variate]]
#       -> (12: (2, 12, 137), 24: (2, 24, 137), 36: (2, 36, 137), 48: (2, 48, 137))
```

## Todo

- [x] beef up the transformer with latest findings
- [x] improvise a 2d version across both variates and time
- [x] improvise a version that includes fft tokens
- [x] improvise a variant that uses adaptive normalization conditioned on statistics across all variates
