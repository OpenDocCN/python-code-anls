## Compressive Transformer in Pytorch

Pytorch implementation of <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SylKikSYDH">Compressive Transformers</a>, a variant of Transformer-XL with compressed memory for long-range language modelling. I will also combine this with an idea from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06764">another paper</a> that adds gating at the residual intersection. The memory and the gating may be synergistic, and lead to further improvements in both language modeling as well as reinforcement learning.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install compressive_transformer_pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from compressive_transformer_pytorch import CompressiveTransformer

model = CompressiveTransformer(
    num_tokens = 20000,
    emb_dim = 128,                 # embedding dimensions, embedding factorization from Albert paper
    dim = 512,
    depth = 12,
    seq_len = 1024,
    mem_len = 1024,                # memory length
    cmem_len = 1024 // 4,          # compressed memory buffer length
    cmem_ratio = 4,                # compressed memory ratio, 4 was recommended in paper
    reconstruction_loss_weight = 1,# weight to place on compressed memory reconstruction loss
    attn_dropout = 0.1,            # dropout post-attention
    ff_dropout = 0.1,              # dropout in feedforward
    attn_layer_dropout = 0.1,      # dropout for attention layer output
    gru_gated_residual = True,     # whether to gate the residual intersection, from 'Stabilizing Transformer for RL' paper
    mogrify_gru = False,           # experimental feature that adds a mogrifier for the update and residual before gating by the GRU
    memory_layers = range(6, 13),  # specify which layers to use long-range memory, from 'Do Transformers Need LR Memory' paper
    ff_glu = True                  # use GLU variant for feedforward
)

inputs = torch.randint(0, 256, (1, 2048))
masks = torch.ones_like(inputs).bool()

segments = inputs.reshape(1, -1, 1024).transpose(0, 1)
masks = masks.reshape(1, -1, 1024).transpose(0, 1)

logits, memories, aux_loss = model(segments[0], mask = masks[0])
logits,        _, aux_loss = model(segments[1], mask = masks[1], memories = memories)

# memories is a named tuple that contains the memory (mem) and the compressed memory (cmem)
```

When training, you can use the `AutoregressiveWrapper` to have memory management across segments taken care of for you. As easy as it gets.

```python
import torch
from compressive_transformer_pytorch import CompressiveTransformer
from compressive_transformer_pytorch import AutoregressiveWrapper

model = CompressiveTransformer(
    num_tokens = 20000,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6,
    seq_len = 1024,
    mem_len = 1024,
    cmem_len = 256,
    cmem_ratio = 4,
    memory_layers = [5,6]
).cuda()

model = AutoregressiveWrapper(model)

inputs = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 2048 + 1)).cuda()

for loss, aux_loss, _ in model(inputs, return_loss = True):
    (loss + aux_loss).backward()
    # optimizer step and zero grad

# ... after much training ...

# generation is also greatly simplified and automated away
# just pass in the prime, which can be 1 start token or any length
# all is taken care of for you

prime = torch.ones(1, 1).cuda()  # assume 1 is start token
sample = model.generate(prime, 4096)
```
