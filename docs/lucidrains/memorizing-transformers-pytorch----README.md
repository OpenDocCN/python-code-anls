## Memorizing Transformers - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08913">Memorizing Transformers</a> (ICLR 2022), attention net augmented with indexing and retrieval of memories using approximate nearest neighbors, in Pytorch

This repository deviates from the paper slightly, using a hybrid attention across attention logits local and distant (rather than the sigmoid gate setup). It also uses cosine similarity attention (with learned temperature) for the KNN attention layer.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install memorizing-transformers-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from memorizing_transformers_pytorch import MemorizingTransformer

model = MemorizingTransformer(
    num_tokens = 20000,                 # number of tokens
    dim = 512,                          # dimension
    dim_head = 64,                      # dimension per attention head
    depth = 8,                          # number of layers
    memorizing_layers = (4, 5),         # which layers to have ANN memories
    max_knn_memories = 64000,           # maximum ANN memories to keep (once it hits this capacity, it will be reset for now, due to limitations in faiss' ability to remove entries)
    num_retrieved_memories = 32,        # number of ANN memories to retrieve
    clear_memories_on_sos_token_id = 1, # clear passed in ANN memories automatically for batch indices which contain this specified SOS token id - otherwise, you can also manually iterate through the ANN memories and clear the indices before the next iteration
)

data = torch.randint(0, 20000, (2, 1024)) # mock data

knn_memories = model.create_knn_memories(batch_size = 2) # create collection of KNN memories with the correct batch size (2 in example)

logits = model(data, knn_memories = knn_memories) # (1, 1024, 20000)
```

You can make the KNN memories read-only by setting `add_knn_memory` on forward to `False`

ex.

```python
logits = model(data, knn_memories = knn_memories, add_knn_memory = False) # knn memories will not be updated
```

With Transformer-XL memories (only the memories that will be discarded will be added to the KNN memory)

```python
import torch
from memorizing_transformers_pytorch import MemorizingTransformer

model = MemorizingTransformer(
    num_tokens = 20000,
    dim = 512,
    depth = 8,
    memorizing_layers = (4, 5),
    max_knn_memories = 64000,
    num_retrieved_memories = 32,
    clear_memories_on_sos_token_id = 1,
    xl_memory_layers = (2, 3, 4, 5),      # xl memory layers - (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03356 shows you do not need XL memory on all layers, just the latter ones) - if a KNNAttention layer ends up using XL memories, only the XL memories that will be discarded will be added to long term memory
    xl_max_memories = 512,                # number of xl memories to keep
    shift_knn_memories_down = 1,          # let a layer look at the KNN memories this number of layers above
    shift_xl_memories_down = 1,           # let a layer look at the XL memories this number of layers above, shown to enhance receptive field in ernie-doc paper
)

data = torch.randint(0, 20000, (2, 1024)) # mock data

xl_memories = None

with model.knn_memories_context(batch_size = 2) as knn_memories:
    logits1, xl_memories = model(data, knn_memories = knn_memories, xl_memories = xl_memories)
    logits2, xl_memories = model(data, knn_memories = knn_memories, xl_memories = xl_memories)
    logits3, xl_memories = model(data, knn_memories = knn_memories, xl_memories = xl_memories)

    # ... and so on
```

## KNN Memory

This repository contains a wrapper around Faiss that can automatically store and retrieve key / values

```python
import torch
from memorizing_transformers_pytorch import KNNMemory

memory = KNNMemory(
    dim = 64,                   # dimension of key / values
    max_memories = 64000,       # maximum number of memories to keep (will throw out the oldest memories for now if it overfills)
    num_indices = 2             # this should be equivalent to batch dimension, as each batch keeps track of its own memories, expiring when it sees a new document
)

memory.add(torch.randn(2, 512, 2, 64))  # (batch, seq, key | value, feature dim)
memory.add(torch.randn(2, 512, 2, 64))

memory.clear([0]) # clear batch 0, if it saw an <sos>

memory.add(torch.randn(2, 512, 2, 64))
memory.add(torch.randn(2, 512, 2, 64))

key_values, mask = memory.search(torch.randn(2, 512, 64), topk = 32)
```

## Training

Enwik8 training

```bash
$ python train.py
```

## Todo

- [x] switch to ivfhnsw and just remember all memories
- [x] enwik8 demo
- [x] validation for enwik8
- [x] solve gradient accumulation problem by offering some way to scope reads and writes to knn memories with another indices array
- [ ] setup text generation with memories
- [ ] figure out how to deal with memories efficiently once capacity has been hit
- [ ] try to speed up reading and writing to knn memories collection with multiprocessing
