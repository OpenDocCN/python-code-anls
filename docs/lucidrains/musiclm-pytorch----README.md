## MusicLM - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/">MusicLM</a>, Google's new SOTA model for music generation using attention networks, in Pytorch.

They are basically using text-conditioned <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/audiolm-pytorch">AudioLM</a>, but surprisingly with the embeddings from a text-audio contrastive learned model named <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12415">MuLan</a>. MuLan is what will be built out in this repository, with AudioLM modified from the other repository to support the music generation needs here.

## Usage

```install
$ pip install musiclm-pytorch
```

## Usage

`MuLaN` first needs to be trained

```python
import torch
from musiclm_pytorch import MuLaN, AudioSpectrogramTransformer, TextTransformer

audio_transformer = AudioSpectrogramTransformer(
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 8,
    dim_head = 64,
    spec_n_fft = 128,
    spec_win_length = 24,
    spec_aug_stretch_factor = 0.8
)

text_transformer = TextTransformer(
    dim = 512,
    depth = 6,
    heads = 8,
    dim_head = 64
)

mulan = MuLaN(
    audio_transformer = audio_transformer,
    text_transformer = text_transformer
)

# get a ton of <sound, text> pairs and train

wavs = torch.randn(2, 1024)
texts = torch.randint(0, 20000, (2, 256))

loss = mulan(wavs, texts)
loss.backward()

# after much training, you can embed sounds and text into a joint embedding space
# for conditioning the audio LM

embeds = mulan.get_audio_latents(wavs)  # during training

embeds = mulan.get_text_latents(texts)  # during inference
```

To obtain the conditioning embeddings for the three transformers that are a part of `AudioLM`, you must use the `MuLaNEmbedQuantizer` as so

```python
from musiclm_pytorch import MuLaNEmbedQuantizer

# setup the quantizer with the namespaced conditioning embeddings, unique per quantizer as well as namespace (per transformer)

quantizer = MuLaNEmbedQuantizer(
    mulan = mulan,                          # pass in trained mulan from above
    conditioning_dims = (1024, 1024, 1024), # say all three transformers have model dimensions of 1024
    namespaces = ('semantic', 'coarse', 'fine')
)

# now say you want the conditioning embeddings for semantic transformer

wavs = torch.randn(2, 1024)
conds = quantizer(wavs = wavs, namespace = 'semantic') # (2, 8, 1024) - 8 is number of quantizers
```

To train (or finetune) the three transformers that are a part of `AudioLM`, you simply follow the instructions over at `audiolm-pytorch` for training, but pass in the `MulanEmbedQuantizer` instance to the training classes under the keyword `audio_conditioner`

ex. `SemanticTransformerTrainer`

```python
import torch
from audiolm_pytorch import HubertWithKmeans, SemanticTransformer, SemanticTransformerTrainer

wav2vec = HubertWithKmeans(
    checkpoint_path = './hubert/hubert_base_ls960.pt',
    kmeans_path = './hubert/hubert_base_ls960_L9_km500.bin'
)

semantic_transformer = SemanticTransformer(
    num_semantic_tokens = wav2vec.codebook_size,
    dim = 1024,
    depth = 6,
    audio_text_condition = True      # this must be set to True (same for CoarseTransformer and FineTransformers)
).cuda()

trainer = SemanticTransformerTrainer(
    transformer = semantic_transformer,
    wav2vec = wav2vec,
    audio_conditioner = quantizer,   # pass in the MulanEmbedQuantizer instance above
    folder ='/path/to/audio/files',
    batch_size = 1,
    data_max_length = 320 * 32,
    num_train_steps = 1
)

trainer.train()
```

After much training on all three transformers (semantic, coarse, fine), you will pass your finetuned or trained-from-scratch `AudioLM` and `MuLaN` wrapped in `MuLaNEmbedQuantizer` to the `MusicLM`

```python
# you need the trained AudioLM (audio_lm) from above
# with the MulanEmbedQuantizer (mulan_embed_quantizer)

from musiclm_pytorch import MusicLM

musiclm = MusicLM(
    audio_lm = audio_lm,                 # `AudioLM` from https://github.com/lucidrains/audiolm-pytorch
    mulan_embed_quantizer = quantizer    # the `MuLaNEmbedQuantizer` from above
)

music = musiclm('the crystalline sounds of the piano in a ballroom', num_samples = 4) # sample 4 and pick the top match with mulan
```

## Todo

- [x] mulan seems to be using decoupled contrastive learning, offer that as an option
- [x] wrap mulan with mulan wrapper and quantize the output, project to audiolm dimensions
- [x] modify audiolm to accept conditioning embeddings, optionally take care of different dimensions through a separate projection
- [x] audiolm and mulan goes into musiclm and generate, filter with mulan
- [x] give dynamic positional bias to self attention in AST
- [x] implement MusicLM generating multiple samples and selecting top match with MuLaN

- [ ] support variable lengthed audio with masking in audio transformer
- [ ] add a version of mulan to <a href="https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip">open clip</a>
- [ ] set all the proper spectrogram hyperparameters
