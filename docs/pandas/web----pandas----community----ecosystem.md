# Ecosystem

Increasingly, packages are being built on top of pandas to address
specific needs in data preparation, analysis and visualization. This is
encouraging because it means pandas is not only helping users to handle
their data tasks but also that it provides a better starting point for
developers to build powerful and more focused data tools. The creation
of libraries that complement pandas' functionality also allows pandas
development to remain focused around its original requirements.

This is an community-maintained list of projects that build on pandas in order
to provide tools in the PyData space. The pandas core development team does not necessarily endorse any particular project on this list or have any knowledge of the maintenance status of any particular library.

For a more complete list of projects that depend on pandas, see the [libraries.io usage page for
pandas](https://libraries.io/pypi/pandas/usage) or [search pypi for
pandas](https://pypi.org/search/?q=pandas).

We'd like to make it easier for users to find these projects, if you
know of other substantial projects that you feel should be on this list,
please let us know.

Jupyter Notebook is a web application for creating Jupyter notebooks. A
Jupyter notebook is a JSON document containing an ordered list of
input/output cells which can contain code, text, mathematics, plots and
rich media. Jupyter notebooks can be converted to a number of open
standard output formats (HTML, HTML presentation slides, LaTeX, PDF,
ReStructuredText, Markdown, Python) through 'Download As' in the web
interface and `jupyter convert` in a shell.

Pandas DataFrames implement `_repr_html_`and `_repr_latex` methods which
are utilized by Jupyter Notebook for displaying (abbreviated) HTML or
LaTeX tables. LaTeX output is properly escaped. (Note: HTML tables may
or may not be compatible with non-HTML Jupyter output formats.)

See [Options and Settings](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/options.html)
for pandas `display.` settings.

### [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)

Spyder is a cross-platform PyQt-based IDE combining the editing,
analysis, debugging and profiling functionality of a software
development tool with the data exploration, interactive execution, deep
inspection and rich visualization capabilities of a scientific
environment like MATLAB or Rstudio.

Its [Variable
Explorer](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/panes/variableexplorer.html) allows
users to view, manipulate and edit pandas `Index`, `Series`, and
`DataFrame` objects like a "spreadsheet", including copying and
modifying values, sorting, displaying a "heatmap", converting data
types and more. Pandas objects can also be renamed, duplicated, new
columns added, copied/pasted to/from the clipboard (as TSV), and
saved/loaded to/from a file. Spyder can also import data from a variety
of plain text and binary files or the clipboard into a new pandas
DataFrame via a sophisticated import wizard.

Most pandas classes, methods and data attributes can be autocompleted in
Spyder's [Editor](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/panes/editor.html) and [IPython
Console](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/panes/ipythonconsole.html), and Spyder's
[Help pane](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/panes/help.html) can retrieve and
render Numpydoc documentation on pandas objects in rich text with Sphinx
both automatically and on-demand.

- data types defined in [Table Schema specification](http://dataprotocols.org/json-table-schema/#field-types-and-formats)

The interface is always reversible (conversion round trip) with two formats (JSON-NTV and JSON-TableSchema).

Example:

```python
import ntv_pandas as npd

jsn = df.npd.to_json(table=False)  # save df as a JSON-value (format Table Schema if table is True else format NTV )
df  = npd.read_json(jsn)  # load a JSON-value as a `DataFrame`

df.equals(npd.read_json(df.npd.to_json(df)))  # `True` in any case, whether `table=True` or not
```

### [BCPandas](https://github.com/yehoshuadimarsky/bcpandas)

BCPandas provides high performance writes from pandas to Microsoft SQL Server,

group-by, drop_duplicates, etc. These operators are designed to work across
thousands of cores to scale applications. It can interoperate with pandas
DataFrame by reading data from pandas or converting data to pandas so users
can selectively scale parts of their pandas DataFrame applications.

```python
from pycylon import read_csv, DataFrame, CylonEnv
from pycylon.net import MPIConfig

# Initialize Cylon distributed environment
config: MPIConfig = MPIConfig()
env: CylonEnv = CylonEnv(config=config, distributed=True)

df1: DataFrame = read_csv('/tmp/csv1.csv')
df2: DataFrame = read_csv('/tmp/csv2.csv')

### [Hamilton](https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton)

Hamilton is a declarative dataflow framework that came out of Stitch Fix. It was designed to help one manage a
Pandas code base, specifically with respect to feature engineering for machine learning models.

It prescibes an opinionated paradigm, that ensures all code is:

* unit testable
* integration testing friendly
* documentation friendly
* transformation logic is reusable, as it is decoupled from the context of where it is used.
* integratable with runtime data quality checks.

This helps one to scale your pandas code base, at the same time, keeping maintenance costs low.

For more information, see [documentation](https://hamilton.readthedocs.io/).
