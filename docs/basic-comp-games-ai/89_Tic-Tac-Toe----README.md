### Tic-Tac-Toe

The game of tic-tac-toe hardly needs any introduction. In this one, you play versus the computer. Moves are entered by number:
```py
1   2   3

4   5   6

7   8   9
```

If you make any bad moves, the computer will win; if the computer makes a bad move, you can win; otherwise, the game ends in a tie.

A second version of the game is included which prints out the board after each move. This is ideally suited to a CRT terminal, particularly if you modify it to not print out a new board after each move, but rather use the cursor to make the move.

The first program was written by Tom Koos while a student researcher at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry; it was extensively modified by Steve North of Creative Computing. The author of the second game is Curt Flick of Akron, Ohio.
