## Porting Notes

- The original program, designed to be played directly on a printer, drew a track 27 rows long.  To fit better on modern screens, I've shortened the track to 23 rows.  This is adjustable via the "trackLen" value assigned on line 72.

- Also because we're playing on a screen instead of a printer, I'm clearing the screen and pausing briefly before each new update of the track.  This is done via the `clear` API when running in Mini Micro, or by using a VT100 escape sequence in other contexts.
