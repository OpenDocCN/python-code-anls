Original source downloaded from [Vintage Basic](http://www.vintage-basic.net/games.html).

Conversion to [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org).  Note that there are three different programs in this folder, all variations on the "land the LEM on the Moon" idea.

Ways to play:

1. Command-Line MiniScript:
Download for your system from https://miniscript.org/cmdline/, install, and then run the desired program with a command such as:

```py
	miniscript lem.ms
```
2. Mini Micro:
Download Mini Micro from https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro/, launch, and then click the top disk slot and chose "Mount Folder..."  Select the folder containing the MiniScript program and this README file.  Then, at the Mini Micro command prompt, enter:

```py
	load "lem"	// (or "lunar" or "rocket")
	run
```
