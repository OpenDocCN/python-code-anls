### Configuring Players

Register in your account on https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/ and get your password.

```sh
from poke_env import AccountConfiguration
# No authentication required for the local server
my_account_config = AccountConfiguration("your_username", "your_password")
player = Player(account_configuration=my_account_config)

# Authentication required for the official showdown server
from poke_env import AccountConfiguration, ShowdownServerConfiguration
my_account_config = AccountConfiguration("your_username", "your_password")
player = Player(account_configuration=my_account_config, server_configuration=ShowdownServerConfiguration)
```
