/**
 * Alias analysis pass.
 *
 * This pass produces an AliasDb that contains aliasing and mutation
 * information about the graph. Users can use this information to determine
 * whether mutations to the graph are safe, i.e. they don't reorder/change
 * nodes in a way that affects output.
 *
 * Every value with a mutable type (Tensors, Lists, Tuples, etc.) will be
 * associated with one or more "alias sets". If two values share an alias set,
 * that means they may alias, implying that a mutation to one value cannot be
 * reordered past a use of the other. Only reordering two reads of an alias set
 * is considered safe.
 *
 * There is a special alias set called the "wildcard set", which indicates that
 * we're not sure what this value may alias. To be conservative, we consider the
 * wildcard alias set as potentially aliasing any other wildcard value within
 * the same type class. Whenever a value becomes contained by another value,
 * such as when a Tensor is appended to a List[Tensor], the contained element
 * becomes part of the wildcard set.
 *
 * Values that contain other mutable types, such as List[Tensor], are
 * initialized as containing the Wildcard set for all contained mutable types.
 *
 * The AliasDb API references the idea of "mutable" vs "immutable"
 * types. "Mutable" means that the object's value can change, while
 * "immutable" means that the value is fixed. (For example, `List` is
 * mutable, so you can add and delete elements from it. On the other
 * hand, you can't modify a Tuple once you create it, making `Tuple` an
 * immutable container.)
 *
 * `isFrozen` - if the Module is frozen then consider attributes as freshly
 * created objects. Freezing API invokes alias analysis to check if they are
 * mutated internally.
 *
 * `descendFunctionCalls` - recursively analyze function and method calls
 * instead of conservative analysis. Generally analysis should be done after
 * inlining so the implmentation for recursive analysis is unoptimized.
