FX is a toolkit for developers to use to transform ``nn.Module``
instances. FX consists of three main components: a **symbolic tracer,**
an **intermediate representation**, and **Python code generation**. A
demonstration of these components in action:
'''

import torch
# Simple module for demonstration
class MyModule(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.param = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.rand(3, 4))
        self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(4, 5)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x + self.param).clamp(min=0.0, max=1.0)

module = MyModule()

from torch.fx import symbolic_trace
# Symbolic tracing frontend - captures the semantics of the module
symbolic_traced : torch.fx.GraphModule = symbolic_trace(module)

# High-level intermediate representation (IR) - Graph representation
print(symbolic_traced.graph)
"""
graph():
    %x : [num_users=1] = placeholder[target=x]
    %param : [num_users=1] = get_attr[target=param]
    %add : [num_users=1] = call_function[target=operator.add](args = (%x, %param), kwargs = {})
    %linear : [num_users=1] = call_module[target=linear](args = (%add,), kwargs = {})
    %clamp : [num_users=1] = call_method[target=clamp](args = (%linear,), kwargs = {min: 0.0, max: 1.0})
    return clamp
"""

# Code generation - valid Python code
print(symbolic_traced.code)
"""
def forward(self, x):
    param = self.param
    add = x + param;  x = param = None
    linear = self.linear(add);  add = None
    clamp = linear.clamp(min = 0.0, max = 1.0);  linear = None
    return clamp
"""

'''
The **symbolic tracer** performs "symbolic execution" of the Python
code. It feeds fake values, called Proxies, through the code. Operations
on theses Proxies are recorded. More information about symbolic tracing
can be found in the :func:`symbolic_trace` and :class:`Tracer`
documentation.
'''

'''
The **intermediate representation** is the container for the operations
that were recorded during symbolic tracing. It consists of a list of
Nodes that represent function inputs, callsites (to functions, methods,
or :class:`torch.nn.Module` instances), and return values. More information
about the IR can be found in the documentation for :class:`Graph`. The
IR is the format on which transformations are applied.
'''

'''
**Python code generation** is what makes FX a Python-to-Python (or
Module-to-Module) transformation toolkit. For each Graph IR, we can
create valid Python code matching the Graph's semantics. This
functionality is wrapped up in :class:`GraphModule`, which is a
:class:`torch.nn.Module` instance that holds a :class:`Graph` as well as a
``forward`` method generated from the Graph.

intermediate representation -> transforms -> Python code generation)
