@Modified By: mashenquan, 2023/8/22. A definition has been provided for the return value of _think: returning false indicates that further reasoning cannot continue.
@Modified By: mashenquan, 2023-11-1. According to Chapter 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 of RFC 116:
    1. Merge the `recv` functionality into the `_observe` function. Future message reading operations will be
    consolidated within the `_observe` function.
    2. Standardize the message filtering for string label matching. Role objects can access the message labels
    they've subscribed to through the `subscribed_tags` property.
    3. Move the message receive buffer from the global variable `self.rc.env.memory` to the role's private variable
    `self.rc.msg_buffer` for easier message identification and asynchronous appending of messages.
    4. Standardize the way messages are passed: `publish_message` sends messages out, while `put_message` places
    messages into the Role object's private message receive buffer. There are no other message transmit methods.
    5. Standardize the parameters for the `run` function: the `test_message` parameter is used for testing purposes
    only. In the normal workflow, you should use `publish_message` or `put_message` to transmit messages.
@Modified By: mashenquan, 2023-11-4. According to the routing feature plan in Chapter 2.2.3.2 of RFC 113, the routing
    functionality is to be consolidated into the `Environment` class.
