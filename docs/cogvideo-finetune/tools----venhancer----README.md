# Enhance CogVideoX Generated Videos with VEnhancer

This tutorial will guide you through using the VEnhancer tool to enhance videos generated by CogVideoX, including
achieving higher frame rates and higher resolutions.

## Model Introduction

VEnhancer implements spatial super-resolution, temporal super-resolution (frame interpolation), and video refinement in
a unified framework. It can flexibly adapt to different upsampling factors (e.g., 1x~8x) for spatial or temporal
super-resolution. Additionally, it provides flexible control to modify the refinement strength, enabling it to handle
diverse video artifacts.

VEnhancer follows the design of ControlNet, copying the architecture and weights of the multi-frame encoder and middle
block from a pre-trained video diffusion model to build a trainable conditional network. This video ControlNet accepts
low-resolution keyframes and noisy full-frame latents as inputs. In addition to the time step t and prompt, our proposed
video-aware conditioning also includes noise augmentation level Ïƒ and downscaling factor s as additional network
conditioning inputs.

## Hardware Requirements

+ Operating System: Linux (requires xformers dependency)
+ Hardware: NVIDIA GPU with at least 60GB of VRAM per card. Machines such as H100, A100 are recommended.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies as per the official instructions:

```py
git clone https://github.com/Vchitect/VEnhancer.git
cd VEnhancer
## Torch and other dependencies can use those from CogVideoX. If you need to create a new environment, use the following commands:
pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2

## Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Where:

- `input_path` is the path to the input video
- `prompt` is the description of the video content. The prompt used by this tool should be shorter, not exceeding 77
  words. You may need to simplify the prompt used for generating the CogVideoX video.
- `target_fps` is the target frame rate for the video. Typically, 16 fps is already smooth, with 24 fps as the default
  value.
- `up_scale` is recommend to be set to 2,3,4. The target resolution is limited to be around 2k and below.
- `noise_aug` value depends on the input video quality. Lower quality needs higher noise levels, which corresponds to
  stronger refinement. 250~300 is for very low-quality videos. good videos: <= 200.
- `steps`  if you want fewer steps, please change solver_mode to "normal" first, then decline the number of steps. "
  fast" solver_mode has fixed steps (15).
  The code will automatically download the required models from Hugging Face during execution.

Typical runtime logs are as follows:

Running on a single A100 GPU, enhancing each 6-second CogVideoX generated video with default settings will consume 60GB
of VRAM and take 40-50 minutes.
