# CogVideoX diffusers Fine-tuning Guide

[中文阅读](./README_zh.md)

[日本語で読む](./README_ja.md)

This feature is not fully complete yet. If you want to check the fine-tuning for the SAT version, please
see [here](../sat/README_zh.md). The dataset format is different from this version.

## Hardware Requirements

+ CogVideoX-2B / 5B LoRA: 1 * A100 (5B need to use `--use_8bit_adam`)
+ CogVideoX-2B SFT:  8 * A100 (Working)
+ CogVideoX-5B-I2V is not supported yet.

## Install Dependencies

Since the related code has not been merged into the diffusers release, you need to base your fine-tuning on the
diffusers branch. Please follow the steps below to install dependencies:

```py
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers.git
cd diffusers # Now in Main branch
pip install -e .
```

## Prepare the Dataset

First, you need to prepare the dataset. The dataset format should be as follows, with `videos.txt` containing the list
of videos in the `videos` directory:

```py
.
├── prompts.txt
├── videos
└── videos.txt
```

You can download
the [Disney Steamboat Willie](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Wild-Heart/Disney-VideoGeneration-Dataset) dataset from
here.

This video fine-tuning dataset is used as a test for fine-tuning.

## Configuration Files and Execution

The `accelerate` configuration files are as follows:

+ `accelerate_config_machine_multi.yaml`: Suitable for multi-GPU use

```

## Running the Script to Start Fine-tuning

Single Node (One GPU or Multi GPU) fine-tuning:

```py
bash finetune_single_rank.sh
```

Multi-Node fine-tuning:

```py
bash finetune_multi_rank.sh # Needs to be run on each node
```

## Loading the Fine-tuned Model

+ Please refer to [cli_demo.py](../inference/cli_demo.py) for how to load the fine-tuned model.

## Best Practices

+ Includes 70 training videos with a resolution of `200 x 480 x 720` (frames x height x width). By skipping frames in
  the data preprocessing, we created two smaller datasets with 49 and 16 frames to speed up experimentation, as the
  maximum frame limit recommended by the CogVideoX team is 49 frames. We split the 70 videos into three groups of 10,
  25, and 50 videos, with similar conceptual nature.
+ Using 25 or more videos works best when training new concepts and styles.
+ It works better to train using identifier tokens specified with `--id_token`. This is similar to Dreambooth training,
  but regular fine-tuning without such tokens also works.
+ The original repository used `lora_alpha` set to 1. We found this value ineffective across multiple runs, likely due
  to differences in the backend and training setup. Our recommendation is to set `lora_alpha` equal to rank or rank //
    2.
+ We recommend using a rank of 64 or higher.
