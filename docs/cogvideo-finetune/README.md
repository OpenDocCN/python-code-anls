## Project Updates

- üî•üî• **News**: ```py/10/13```: A more cost-effective fine-tuning framework for `CogVideoX-5B` that works with a single 4090 GPU, [cogvideox-factory](https://github.com/a-r-r-o-w/cogvideox-factory), has been released. It supports fine-tuning with multiple resolutions. Feel free to use it!
- üî• **News**: ```py/10/10```: We have updated our technical report. Please click [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06072) to view it. More training details and a demo have been added. To see the demo, click [here](https://yzy-thu.github.io/CogVideoX-demo/).- üî• **News**: ```py/10/09```: We have publicly released the [technical documentation](https://zhipu-ai.feishu.cn/wiki/DHCjw1TrJiTyeukfc9RceoSRnCh) for CogVideoX fine-tuning on Feishu, further increasing distribution flexibility. All examples in the public documentation can be fully reproduced.
- üî• **News**: ```py/9/19```: We have open-sourced the CogVideoX series image-to-video model **CogVideoX-5B-I2V**.
  This model can take an image as a background input and generate a video combined with prompt words, offering greater
  controllability. With this, the CogVideoX series models now support three tasks: text-to-video generation, video
  continuation, and image-to-video generation. Welcome to try it online
  at [Experience](https://huggingface.co/spaces/THUDM/CogVideoX-5B-Space).
- üî• ```py/9/19```: The Caption
  model [CogVLM2-Caption](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/cogvlm2-llama3-caption), used in the training process of
  CogVideoX to convert video data into text descriptions, has been open-sourced. Welcome to download and use it.
- üî• ```py/8/27```: We have open-sourced a larger model in the CogVideoX series, **CogVideoX-5B**. We have
  significantly optimized the model's inference performance, greatly lowering the inference threshold. You can run *
  *CogVideoX-2B** on older GPUs like `GTX 1080TI`, and **CogVideoX-5B** on desktop GPUs like `RTX 3060`. Please strictly
  follow the [requirements](requirements.txt) to update and install dependencies, and refer
  to [cli_demo](inference/cli_demo.py) for inference code. Additionally, the open-source license for the **CogVideoX-2B
  ** model has been changed to the **Apache 2.0 License**.
- üî• ```py/8/6```: We have open-sourced **3D Causal VAE**, used for **CogVideoX-2B**, which can reconstruct videos with
  almost no loss.
- üî• ```py/8/6```: We have open-sourced the first model of the CogVideoX series video generation models, **CogVideoX-2B
  **.
- üå± **Source**: ```py/5/19```: We have open-sourced the CogVideo video generation model (now you can see it in
  the `CogVideo` branch). This is the first open-source large Transformer-based text-to-video generation model. You can

## Quick Start

### Prompt Optimization

Before running the model, please refer to [this guide](inference/convert_demo.py) to see how we use large models like
GLM-4 (or other comparable products, such as GPT-4) to optimize the model. This is crucial because the model is trained
with long prompts, and a good prompt directly impacts the quality of the video generation.

### SAT

**Please make sure your Python version is between 3.10 and 3.12, inclusive of both 3.10 and 3.12.**

Follow instructions in [sat_demo](sat/README.md): Contains the inference code and fine-tuning code of SAT weights. It is
recommended to improve based on the CogVideoX model structure. Innovative researchers use this code to better perform
rapid stacking and development.

### Diffusers

**Please make sure your Python version is between 3.10 and 3.12, inclusive of both 3.10 and 3.12.**

```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then follow [diffusers_demo](inference/cli_demo.py): A more detailed explanation of the inference code, mentioning the
significance of common parameters.

For more details on quantized inference, please refer
to [diffusers-torchao](https://github.com/sayakpaul/diffusers-torchao/). With Diffusers and TorchAO, quantized inference
is also possible leading to memory-efficient inference as well as speedup in some cases when compiled. A full list of
memory and time benchmarks with various settings on A100 and H100 has been published
at [diffusers-torchao](https://github.com/sayakpaul/diffusers-torchao).

**Data Explanation**

+ While testing using the diffusers library, all optimizations included in the diffusers library were enabled. This
  scheme has not been tested for actual memory usage on devices outside of **NVIDIA A100 / H100** architectures.
  Generally, this scheme can be adapted to all **NVIDIA Ampere architecture** and above devices. If optimizations are
  disabled, memory consumption will multiply, with peak memory usage being about 3 times the value in the table.
  However, speed will increase by about 3-4 times. You can selectively disable some optimizations, including:

```py
pipe.enable_sequential_cpu_offload()
pipe.vae.enable_slicing()
pipe.vae.enable_tiling()
```

+ For multi-GPU inference, the `enable_sequential_cpu_offload()` optimization needs to be disabled.
+ Using INT8 models will slow down inference, which is done to accommodate lower-memory GPUs while maintaining minimal
  video quality loss, though inference speed will significantly decrease.
+ The CogVideoX-2B model was trained in `FP16` precision, and all CogVideoX-5B models were trained in `BF16` precision.
  We recommend using the precision in which the model was trained for inference.
+ [PytorchAO](https://github.com/pytorch/ao) and [Optimum-quanto](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-quanto/) can be
  used to quantize the text encoder, transformer, and VAE modules to reduce the memory requirements of CogVideoX. This
  allows the model to run on free T4 Colabs or GPUs with smaller memory! Also, note that TorchAO quantization is fully
  compatible with `torch.compile`, which can significantly improve inference speed. FP8 precision must be used on
  devices with NVIDIA H100 and above, requiring source installation of `torch`, `torchao`, `diffusers`, and `accelerate`
  Python packages. CUDA 12.4 is recommended.
+ The inference speed tests also used the above memory optimization scheme. Without memory optimization, inference speed
  increases by about 10%. Only the `diffusers` version of the model supports quantization.
+ The model only supports English input; other languages can be translated into English for use via large model
  refinement.
+ The memory usage of model fine-tuning is tested in an `8 * H100` environment, and the program automatically
  uses `Zero 2` optimization. If a specific number of GPUs is marked in the table, that number or more GPUs must be used
  for fine-tuning.
